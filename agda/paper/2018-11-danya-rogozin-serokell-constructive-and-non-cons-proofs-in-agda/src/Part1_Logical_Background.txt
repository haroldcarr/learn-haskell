Outline
- Logical background
  - to see the connection between proof theory and dependently typed programming
- Brief introduction to Agda : a constructive formal system
- Examples : both constructively and non-constructively (by adding non-constructive postulates)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Logical background

Classical logic : Aristotle’s works [1], G. Boole’s [2], G. Frege’s [3]

Establish the truth of a given statement from its form.

Forming complex statements from atomic statements via parts of speech by abstracting from
specific meanings that can vary from context to context.

Atomic statements are propositional variables that can take a value from the two-element set

 { false, true }

Parts of speech are logical connectives: conjunction, disjunction, implication, negation

Classical proof is a syntactical way to establish the truth of a proposition
from a two-valued point of view.

Define axioms and inference rules.

Single inference rule : Modus Ponens. Modus Ponens claims that
  if implication (A → B)
  and
  assumption A
  are true
  then the conclusion B
  is true.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Definition 1 : language of a classical propositional calculus:
Let V = {p0, p1, ...,} be set of propositional variables. Thus:

1. Any propositional variable is a formula;
2. If A is a formula, then ¬A is a formula;
3. If A,B are formulas, then (A ∨ B), (A ∧ B) and (A → B) are formulas.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Definition 2 (Classical propositional calculus)
Classical propositional calculus (CPC) is defined by the following
list of axiom schemes and inference rules:

1. (A → (B → C)) → ((A → B) → (A → C))
2. A → (B → A)
3. A → (B → (A ∧ B))
4. (A ∧ B) → A
5. (A ∧ B) → B
6. (A → C) → ((B → C) → ((A ∨ B) → C))
7. A → (A ∨ B)
8. B → (A ∨ B)
9. (A → B) → ((A → ¬ B) → ¬ A)
10. ¬ ¬ A → A
11. Inference rule, Modus Ponens: A   A → B
                                  ---------
                                          B
Equivalently, we may define classical propositional logic as the smallest set L
that consists of all special cases of these schemas and is closed under Modus Ponens rule,
i.e. if A ∈ L  and A → B ∈ L, then B ∈ L.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Definition 3 (Formal proof)
A (classical propositional) proof is a finite sequence of formulas,
each of which is an axiom, or follows from the previous formulas by Modus Ponens rule.

Example: prove A → A

(1) (A→((A→A)→A)) → (((A→(A→A))→(A→A))
    Axiom schema
(2) A → ((A→A)→A)
    Axiom schema
(3) ((A→(A→A)) → (A→A)
    1, 2, Modus Ponens
(4) A → (A→A)
    Axiom schema
(5) A → A
    1, 2, Modus Ponens

Law of excluded middle initially formulated in Aristotle’s works [1].
Claims only one statement of A and ¬A is true and the other is false (no third option).

  A ∨ ¬ A

Exercise : prove the law of excluded middle in CPC.

Equivalent formulation : law of double negation elimination:
Any statement is equivalent to its double negation:
If it is false that A is false, then A is true.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First-order logic

Classical propositional logic has weak expressive possibilities.
It does not include the structure of propositions.
The structure of a statement often plays a role in establishing the truth of this statement.
Example,

“A sequence of real numbers x1, x2, ... is a Cauchy sequence,
if for all ε > 0 there exists a natural number N, such that for all i,j > N, |xi − xj| < ε”.

No way to establish trust of “for all ε > 0  …” only looking on connectives.
Need to deal with internal structure.

First-order logic (FOL) is a richer formal system than (classical) propositional logic
that enables expressing the internal structure of basic propositions in more detail.

The language of FOL extends the language of classical propositional logic.
In addition to logical connectives, there are

- variables        : infinite set of letters x,y,z,...
                     range over some domain
- constants        : a,b,c,...
                     denote special elements of a domain
- relation symbols : set of letters P,Q,R, ...
                     an infinite collection of n-ary relation symbols for every n ∈ N
                     symbols are symbols that represent relations
- function symbols : set of letters f,g,h,...
                     an infinite collection of n-ary function symbols for any natural number n;
                     symbols that denote operations
- quantifiers      : “for all” ∀, “there exists” ∃


Note : any propositional variable is 0-ary relation symbol.
       any constant is 0-ary function symbol
       (i.e., propositional variables and constants are not strictly necessary)

First-order formulas are built via:

A first-order signature is a pair Ω = ⟨Fn,Pr⟩,
where Fn is a set of function symbols
and   Pr is a set of relation symbols.

Definition 4 (Terms)

- Any variable is a term
- Any constant is a term
- If x1,…,xn are terms and f ∈ Fn is a function symbol of valence n, then f(x1,…,xn) is a term

Definition 5 (Formulas)

- If x1,…,xn are terms and P ∈ Pr is a relation symbol of valence n, then P(x1,…,xn) is a formula
- If A is a formula, then ¬A is a formula
- If A,B are formulas, then (AαB) is a formula, where α ∈ →, ∧, ∨
- If A is a formula and x is a variable, then ∀x:A (for all x, A holds)
  and ∃x:A (exists x, such that A holds) are formulas

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Define first-order logic axiomatically as first-order predicate calculus:

Definition 6 (Classical first-order predicate calculus)

1. CPC axioms;
2. ∀x A(x) → A(a)
3. A(a) → ∃x A(x)
4. Modus Ponens
5. 1st Bernays’ rule: A → B
                      -----
                     A → ∀x B'
6. 2nd Bernays’ rule: A → B
                      -----
                     ∃x A → B
   where A, B are metavariables on formulas.

A proof is a finite sequence of formulas, each of which is an axiom,
or follows from the previous formulas by inference rules (Modus Ponens and Bernays’ rules).

∃x A is equivalent to ¬(∀x¬A)
∀x A is equivalent to ¬(∃x¬A)
(i.e., . quantifiers are mutually expressible in classical first-order logic)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Constructive logic

Constructive (or intuitionistic) mathematics arose at the beginning of
the 20th century, by Dutch mathematician L. E. J. Brouwer to provide
an answer to the paradoxes of naive set theory such as Russell’s
paradox [4].

Brouwer claimed that paradoxes are the evidence that classical
mathematics and its foundation are unsafe.

Misgivings about ways of reasoning on mathematical objects and their introduction [5].
E.g., examples of theorems claiming the existence of an object with some desired property
but proved without any explicit presentation of this object.

Example : "There exist irrational numbers a and b such that a^b is a rational number.
(Proof not shown.)
Such proofs are often based on the law of excluded middle (A∨¬A)
and/or do not propose any concrete object (here, specific rational numbers).

By the definition, a proof A ∨ ¬A is either proof of A or proof of ¬A,
but classically A ∨ ¬A is true without any proof of A or ¬A.

Rejection of the law of excluded middle.

A statement is proved if we have some explicit construction
that solves some desired mathematical problem.

Logical connectives are understood as follows (in Haskell notation):

- A proof of (a, b) is an ordered pair (x, y), where x :: a and y :: b.
  To prove both statements, then must prove each of them;
- A proof of Either a b is either Left x or Right y, where x :: a and y :: b.
  To prove a disjunction, then must must prove at least one of members.
- A proof of a -> b is a function f such that for all x :: a, f x :: b.
  To prove this implication, must have a method that reduces any proof of b to the proof of a;
- A proof ¬ a is a proof of a -> Void, where Void is an empty type.

Logically, Void denotes the absurdity, the statement that has no proof
- e.g., 0 = 1
- To prove the negation of a, must show that any proof of a leads to the contradiction

E.g., 4 = 5 → 0 = 1 is equivalent to ¬(4 = 5)


Type-theoretically, Void is a type of contradiction and has no values
as far as the contradiction is not provable (if the system is consistent).
a -> Void may be considered as a type of function with an empty range of values.

This way of the interpretation of logical constants is called
Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov semantics (BHK-semantics) [7].

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Intuitionistic propositional logic axiomatically
Definition 7 (Intuitionistic propositional logic)

 1. (A → (B → C)) → ((A → B) → (A → C))
 2. A → (B → A)
 3. A → (B → (A ∧ B))
 4. (A ∧ B) → A
 5. (A ∧ B) → B
 6. (A → C) → ((B → C) → ((A ∨ B) → C))
 7. A → (A ∨ B)
 8. B → (A ∨ B)
 9. (A → B) → ((A → ¬ B) → ¬ A)
10. A → (¬ A → B)
11. Inference rule, Modus Ponens: A   A → B
                                  ---------
                                          B

In other words, replace the last axioms of classical propositional logic
   ¬ ¬ A → A
with weaker axiom
  A → (¬ A → B)
to obtain intuitionistic propositional logic.

Moreover, there is Theorem 2 Disjunction property
 (Gödel [1932], Gentzen [1934], Kleene [1945]) [8] [9] [10]
A v B is provable intuitionistically if and only if either
- A is provable intuitionistically or
- B is provable intuitionistically.

FWIW: unprovability of the law of excluded middle may be considered to
be the consequence of the disjunction property:

A v ¬ A cannot be provable generally, because no possibility to establish the
provability of this disjunction knowing nothing about A.

Note that the disjunction property doesn’t work in classical logic,
where A v ¬ A is provable and true regardless of what A is

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Intuitionistic propositional logic extended to intuitionistic first-order logic
Definition 8 Intuitionistic first-order predicate calculus

1. IPC axioms
2. ∀x A(x) → A(a)
3. A(a) → ∃x A(x)
4. Modus Ponens
5. Bernays’ rules

Note that, quantifiers are not mutually expressible in contrast to classical first-order logic.

There is the following theorem about intuitionistic first-order logic
which is wrong for classical first-order logic:

Theorem 3 (Existence property [9])

If ∃x A(x) is provable in intuitionistic first-order logic with signature Ω,
then there exists some term t, such that A(t) is provable.

Existence should be proved explicitly from an intuitionistic point of view.

See [11] to read more about philosophical distinctions between
classical and intuitionistic logic in more detail.

Also, The statement formulated in Theorem 1 has a constructive proof (not shown).

-- 2.3 Validity, satisfiability and tautology

{-
Valuation v *satisfies* a formula p if eval p v = true.  A formula is said to be:

- a tautology or logically valid if is satisfied by all valuations,
  - truth-table is ‘true’ in all rows
  - ‘always true’
  - like equation true for all values of vars : x2 − y2 = (x + y)(x − y)
- satisfiable if it is satisfied by some valuation(s)
  - truth-table is ‘true’ in at least one row;
  - ‘sometimes (but possibly not always) true’
  - like equation that has at least one solution : x2 + 2 = 3x
- unsatisfiable or a contradiction if no valuation satisfies it
  - truth-table is ‘false’ in all rows.
  - ‘always false’
  - like unsolvable equation : 0 * x = 1

tautology is also satisfiable

unsatisfiable if it is not satisfiable

in any valuation eval (¬p) v is false iff eval p v is true
- so p is a tautology if and only if ¬p is unsatisfiable.

{-
extend (un)satisfiability to a set of formulas:
- set Γ of formulas is said to be satisfiable
  if there is a valuation v that simultaneously satisfies them all

Note the ‘simultaneously’
- {p ∧ ¬q, ¬p ∧ q} is unsatisfiable even though each formula by itself is satisfiable.

When the set concerned is finite, Γ = {p1 ,..., pn},
- satisfiability of Γ is equivalent to p1 ∧ ··· ∧ pn
- later will need to consider satisfiability of infinite sets of formulas, so that doesn't work

Notation Γ |= q : means ‘for all valuations in which all p ∈ Γ are true, q is true’.
- in case of finite Γ = {p1 ,..., pn}, equivalent to assertion p1 ∧ ··· ∧ pn ⇒ q is a tautology
- in the case Γ = emptySet, common to write |= p, meaning p is a tautology.

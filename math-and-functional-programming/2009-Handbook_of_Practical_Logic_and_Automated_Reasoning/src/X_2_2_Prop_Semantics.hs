Theorem 2.1 For any prop formula p, the set atoms(p) is finite.
Proof By induction on structure of p.

- If p is T or F, then atoms(p) is the empty set: finite.
- If p is an atom, atoms(p) is a singleton set: finite.
- If p is of form ~q, then by the induction hypothesis, atoms(q) is finite
  and by definition atoms(¬q) = atoms(q).
- If p is of the form q ∧ r, q ∨ r, q ⇒ r or q ⇔ r, then atoms(p) = atoms(q) ∪ atoms(r).
  By inductive hypothesis, both atoms(q) and atoms(r) are finite
  and the union of two finite sets is finite. QED

Theorem 2.2 For any prop formula p, if two valuations υ and υ' agree on atoms(p)
(i.e. υ(x) = υ'(x) for all x in atoms(p)), then eval p υ = eval p υ'.
Proof By induction on structure of p.
- If p is of T or F, then it is independent of the valuation.
- If p is atom x, then atoms(x) = {x} and by assumption υ(x) = υ'(x).
  Hence eval p υ = υ(x) = υ'(x) = eval p υ'.
- If p is q ∧ r, q ∨ r, q ⇒ r or q ⇔ r, then atoms(p) = atoms(q) ∪ atoms(r).
  Since valuations agree on the union of the two sets, they agree, a fortiori, on each of atoms(q)
  and atoms(r).
  We can therefore apply the inductive hypothesis to conclude
  that eval q υ = eval q υ' and
  that eval r υ = eval r υ'.
  Since evaluation of p is a function of these subevaluations, eval p υ = eval p υ'. QED

Implication
p ⇒ q not like English reading ‘p implies q’ or ‘if p then q’.

truth-value of p ⇒ q in terms of truth-values of p and q

semantics is only reasonable one

intuitively : if p and p ⇒ q are true, then so is q
- consequently if p is true and q is false, then p ⇒ q must be false

Possible that p ∧ q ⇒ p is always true: semantics makes this true whatever truth-values of p and q

English : ‘p implies q’ or ‘if p then q’ mean a causal connection between p and q.

Does not seem reasonable to assert ‘p implies q’ just because not the case that p/true q/false

definition : ‘p implies q’ is true whenver q is true, regardless of p value
or any relation between p and q

Also ‘p implies q’ is true whenever p is false, regardless of q.
- ‘if the moon is made of cheese then 2 + 2 = 5’ is true

intuitive meaning of ‘if p, then q’ is not simply that we do not have p∧¬q,
but more strongly that we cannot under any circumstances have p ∧ ¬q.

‘whatever the value(s) taken by the component variables’

regard truth-functional conditional ‘p ⇒ q’ as distinct from everyday notions

BI-IMPLICATION: IF AND ONLY IF

‘if and only if ’ : implication in both directions
- ‘p if and only if q’ :
  - ‘p implies q &&
  -  q implies p’.

Prove IFF by proving ‘if p then q’ and ‘if q then p’
(like proving x = y by proving x ≤ y and y ≤ x).

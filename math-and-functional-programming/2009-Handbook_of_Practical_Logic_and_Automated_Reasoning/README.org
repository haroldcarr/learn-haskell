- page xi: The date of death for Thomas Hobbes given after the quotation should be 1679, not 1697.

- page 10, in the discussion of syntax and semantics:
  the phrase "like algebraic manipulations" should not be in quotes.

- page 34,  "As a simple example of ... structural induction ...,    will show"
  should be "As a simple example of ... structural induction ..., we will show"

- page 39, first bullet in section 2.3:
            "if    is satisfied by all valuations"
  should be "if it is satisfied by all valuations"

- page 50, psimplify function should have a clause to simplify
           Iff(False,False) to True,
  since as it stands one gets Not False
  Here is a fixed version of the file prop.ml with this line added.

- page 102, third line from the bottom:
            "and if so returns one    them together"
  should be "and if so returns one of them together"

- page 119, in the second ML box, the power and cosine function are wrong way
  round so this doesn't match the formula above it is supposed to correspond to
  Here is a fixed version of the file fol.ml with this corrected.

- page 128, in the proof of Theorem 3.2,
     "holds M v p = not(holds M v p)" should
  be "holds M v p = not(holds M v q)"

- page 130, second paragraph: "we usually just       |= p"
                    should be "we usually just write |= p"

- page 130, second line of section 3.4: the example of universal closure should
  be universally quantified over both x and z, not just x

- page 142, first displayed formula: to be consistent with the next page, this
  invalid formula should have a bar through the "iff" symbol

- page 144, first paragraph of 3.6: Skolem's first name "Thoraf" should be "Thoralf"

- page 155, proof of Corollary 3.20:
      "... which is exactly Theorem 3.5" should
  say "... which is exactly Lemma   3.5"

- page 166, middle of second paragraph of text:
      "complicated terms like x = g(f(g(y))"
  is missing a right parenthesis and should say "complicated terms like x = g(f(g(y)))"

- page 204, second line: "satisifes" should be
                         "satisfies".

- page 205, first line of proof of Theorem 3.43:
      "right-to-left definition" should be
      "right-to-left direction".

- page 257: in the second rewrite example just above the
     "Abstract reduction relations" section, both instances of
        "a · c + b · d" should read
        "a · c + b · c"

- page 271: the term "local confluence" is used here and several more times but
  it was never explicitly stated that this is alternative terminology for "weak
  confluence" as defined earlier. Either the same terminology should be used
  everywhere or the definition on page 258 should mention both phrases


- page 317, top paragraph (last of section 5.3): there are actually 17 universal
  quantifiers not 19 using the code given in the book, and moreover the number
  of ground instances should be computed by raising that number to the tenth
  power, not vice versa. Thus "... has 19 universal quantifiers ... There are no
  fewer than "1019 ground instances" should be "... has 17 universal quantifiers
  ... There are no fewer than "1710 ground instances"

- page 321, definition 5.1: "valid in all finite models" should be
                            "holds in all finite interpretations"

- page 326: the penultimate paragraph uses RM and plain R somewhat
  inconsistently. While not really likely to cause confusion, they are all with
  respect to the interpretation M so they should all, properly speaking, be RM.

- page 329: "axiomatized by Σ and say that the theory is axiomatizable" should
  say "axiomatized by Σ, and say that the theory is axiomatizable if there is a
  decidable or recursive set Σ that axiomatizes it (see section 7.5)". The
  footnote should probably also have a reference to exercise 7.11.

- page 332, line above displayed formula: "equivalence" should be
                                          "T-equivalence" or "equivalence in the theory of DLOs"

- page 356, Corollary 5.12: this should explicitly state the assumption that we
  are working over an integral domain (Tom Hales).

- page 396, top line: q1(x) = 0 \/ ... qm(x) = 0 should be
                      q1(x) = 0 \/ ... \/ qm(x) = 0.

- page 414, third line: "without affecting   incompleteness" should be
                        "without affecting     completeness"   or
                        "without introducing incompleteness".

- page 449, first paragraph: ICS was based on Shostak, but Yices is actually based on Nelson-Oppen

- page 451, near middle: "Soloray (private communication)" should be
                         "Solovay (private communication)".

- page 457, exercise 5.10: should add "You may need to consider an expanded language"

- page 459, exercise 5.25: this construction only results in a field extension
  where each polynomial with coefficients in the original field F has a root. To
  give the full algebraic closure of F one would need an iterative version of
  the construction

- page 489, second sentence of "Basic equality properties" section: "others properties" should be
                                                                    "other  properties"

- page 497, the OCaml type in the first paragraph should be
     "(term -> term) * fol formula -> thm"

- page 504, second box: note that problem p58 is not in fact Pelletier problem
  58, as the naming would suggest; in general, only those up to p46 correspond
  to Pelletier problems

- page 531, near bottom of first subsection: "nested way inside   term" should be
                                             "nested way inside a term".

- page 591, exercise 7.15: nn ≠ 0 should be bn ≠ 0.

- page 593, fourth line from bottom: "a inequation" should be
                                     "an inequation"


- page 594, middle of page:                      "E[x] symbolizes" should be 
                            "anything of the form E[x] symbolizes"

- page 594, fifth line from bottom:
  "pairs whose first member is in S and whose second member is in T, i.e. {(x,y) | x ∈ S and x ∈ T}" should say
                                                                "... i.e. {(x,y) | x ∈ S and y ∈ T}"

- page 595, discussion below first list of relation properties:
    "the equality relation = has all properties other than irreflexivity" should say
                                           "... other than irreflexivity and connectedness"

- page 597, on the second line of the second paragraph discussing characteristic
  functions, both instances of "f" should be "χS"

- page 610, code in third box: the definition of odd should read "if n = 0 then false ..." rather than
                                                                 "if n = 1 then true ..."
  to ensure that it terminates for all nonnegative integers

- page 626, last sentence: the whole sentence "This takes a flag ... existential"
  is incorrect and should simply be removed

- page 629, first sentence: "use this is one" should be
                            "use this as one"

- page 638, Conway and Sloane reference: "Sloaue" in the volume editor should
                                 also be "Sloane".

- page 640, Dijkstra reference at the bottom of the page: the URL for the
  document www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd12xx/EWD1062.PDF should be
           www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd10xx/EWD1062.PDF

- page 655, Mehlhorn et al. reference: "seel" should be
                                       "Seel"

- page 662, Smorynski (1980) reference: the title "Logic   Number Theory" should be
                                                  "Logical Number Theory"

Not explicitly in the text but in the supplementary examples in the code:

The Pelletier problem 27 is stated incorrectly,
      where "forall x. U(x) ==> ~R(x)"
should read "forall x. V(x) ==> ~R(x)", and this appears in several places.

One of the calls to isubst in "folderived.ml" is not given all its arguments.
Here are fixed version of the files folderived.ml, lcffol.ml, meson.ml, resolution.ml and tableaux.ml

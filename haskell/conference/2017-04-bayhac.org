Haskell/Nix

Crafted customer experiences for businesses.

Evaluates nuanced histories and patterns of individuals.
Craft engagements unique to each customer
— ensuring interaction is welcome, on-point, and well timed.

orchestration via A.I.
- broad array of data, real-time contextual signals, preference filters.
- match workflows to recipients

platform learns and adapts
- feedback via employee, chatbot, implied by customer’s action
- makes each experience better than the last.

blockchain : authoritative record (e.g., two companies and their banks)

fabric 1.0 : platform for exploring blockchain model of computation

blockchain provides
- total order : distributed consensus
- peer-to-peer network
- private/public computation channels
  - private total order part of global total order (but not visible to all)

FABRIC | QUORUM | ASSEMBLY follow above abstraction

FABRIC
- opaque blobs - the data upon which it is operating

CONSENSUS API
- submit blobs
- get a block of blobs at a given block height

CHAINCODE
- the actual transaction code and evaluators
- agreeing on/executing on shared data
- transforms user provided blob and current state of merkle tree into new state of merkle tree

CHAINCODE ?
- who is the admin
- BFT immutability/liveness
- authoritative info utility

FABRIC has a PKI system
- available from within chaincode

Business logic + crypto
- BL attached to arbitrary credentials
- signatures, SNARKS, oblivious Bloom filters...
- strongly order computations

PEERS are not USERS
- neutral multilateral authoritative platform enforces cryptographic computation
- delegate authority to end users
- end users should not have to transfer all privacy interests to peers
- private channels (preserver interests of real users)

HE THINKS ABOUT
- predicate systems where all possible signers are not enumerated when the
  predicate is specified but are replay resistant.
- signature systems for partial and redacted time series data records.

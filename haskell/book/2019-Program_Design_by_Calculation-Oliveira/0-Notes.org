Dear Harold and Mark

It was great to know you in person at FM’19.

The current version of the “book” is at http://www4.di.uminho.pt/~jno/ps/pdbc.pdf

In the last year I added chapters 5, 6 and 7. FM’19 forced me to stop at section 7.9.

These chapters are what I teach to my 4th year students (Lisandra, who was among the best in the 
class, had this still in slide form).

It is more practical to use relations (the Kleisli category of the powerset monad) than keeping using
functions as in chapters 2 to 4. "Functions are special cases of relations", all maths books say 
But they not tell about the monadic flavour of the “aphorism".

About music: the slides I mentioned are http://www4.di.uminho.pt/~jno/ps/cehum13-en.pdf

The “afterthought” in slide 38 eventually became a paper: “Programming from Metaphorisms”
which was fun to write (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352220817301645)

Let us keep in touch. I promise to be back once I find some “Lisandra 2.0” among my students.
It is difficult but sometimes miracles happen

Meanwhile, I will study blockchain.

@Mark: see you on Wednesday

All the best and thanks for attending FM’19!

Abstract for LambdaConf 2015

TITLE : Programming and Math

ABSTRACT:

Design patterns are a useful way to organize software.  Unfortunately,
"gang-of-four"-like patterns are not composable, due to side-effects.
In a pure (i.e., no side-effects) language, functions can be composed.
That makes it possible to leverage patterns from mathematics.  This
talk shows an algebra of function composition, identity functions,
isomorphisms, (co)products (gluing functions that do not compose) and
functors.  It shows how this algebra relates to real-world
programming.  The goal of this talk is to provide an initial intuition
of how to apply patterns from math to programming and to motivate you
to continue studying on your own (perhaps by looking at the "uber"
patterns of Category Theory).  Note: knowing these patterns is NOT
necessary for getting work done in a functional language, but this
talk should give a glimpse of why they may be useful.  The talk
illustrates ideas using Haskell.  It is aimed at FP beginners.

BIO:

Harold Carr is architect of InfiniBand usage in WebLogic Server at
Oracle.  He also designed and implemented the pluggable transports,
the asynchronous client and service APIs, and streaming I/O used in
Oracle's SOAP stack.  At Sun Microsystems he worked on RMI-IIOP
load-balancing and fail-over, the architecture of Sun's CORBA ORB and
JAX-WS 2.0, and the scalable NIO communications architecture (aka
Grizzly).  He worked on distributed Lisp and C++ with Hewlett-Packard
Research Laboratories and Schlumberger Research Laboratories, was
Chief Architect of Lisp technology at Autodesk, and did logic
simulation for Cirrus Logic. He holds a Ph.D., in Computer Science
from the University of Utah.

Design patterns are guides to clean, simple and practical solutions.

Many of the classic OO Gang of Four's patterns are workarounds for the
lack of functional programming constructs such as lambdas and
higher-order functions.

The majority of design patterns can be simplified via FP.
- using pure functions to reduce the proliferation of classes that are used once and thrown away
- removing boilerplate, focus on behaviour
